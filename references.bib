@article{ASHLEY2007,
	abstract = {With the continued growth of the aquaculture industry and increasing scientific discussion over the potential for negative events to give rise to suffering, research into the welfare of cultured fish is vital. How we define and measure welfare is cause for debate, particularly in fish. However, research into the effects of aquaculture procedures on welfare is crucial to produce data and recommendations for best practice and future legislation. Both behavioural and physiological measures of welfare are necessary for correct interpretation and while there is a wealth of knowledge on the physiological consequences of many aquaculture practices it is now equally important for us to understand the behavioural responses to these practices and to relate them to fish welfare. Here I review the scientific data that allows us to interpret the effects of disease, handling, transport, food deprivation, and slaughter technique on fish welfare. The effects of stocking density, also an area of welfare concern, are complex and appear to comprise of numerous interacting and case specific factors. Investigation into the relative importance of these factors, particularly through behavioural studies, will serve to improve welfare. Stocking density, diet, feeding technique, and management procedures all have strong effects on stress responses, subsequent stress tolerance, health, and the occurrence of aggressive behaviour. Strategies to reduce disease susceptibility, minimise stress responses, and avoid aggression are, therefore, vital. However, caution should be taken when interpreting ``abnormal'' fish behaviour and further research is required to allow us to establish the importance of the expression of ``natural'' behaviours. Collectively this growing area of research serves to improve our knowledge of the impacts of aquaculture and intensive farming procedures on fish welfare and is the first step in improving welfare wherever possible.},

@article{NAYLOR2021,
	abstract = {The sustainability of aquaculture has been debated intensely since 2000, when a review on the net contribution of aquaculture to world fish supplies was published in Nature. This paper reviews the developments in global aquaculture from 1997 to 2017, incorporating all industry sub-sectors and highlighting the integration of aquaculture in the global food system. Inland aquaculture---especially in Asia---has contributed the most to global production volumes and food security. Major gains have also occurred in aquaculture feed efficiency and fish nutrition, lowering the fish-in--fish-out ratio for all fed species, although the dependence on marine ingredients persists and reliance on terrestrial ingredients has increased. The culture of both molluscs and seaweed is increasingly recognized for its ecosystem services; however, the quantification, valuation, and market development of these services remain rare. The potential for molluscs and seaweed to support global nutritional security is underexploited. Management of pathogens, parasites, and pests remains a sustainability challenge industry-wide, and the effects of climate change on aquaculture remain uncertain and difficult to validate. Pressure on the aquaculture industry to embrace comprehensive sustainability measures during this 20-year period have improved the governance, technology, siting, and management in many cases.},

@article{KANDIMALIA2022,
	abstract = {<p>The Ocean Aware project, led by Innovasea and funded through Canada's Ocean Supercluster, is developing a fish passage observation platform to monitor fish without the use of traditional tags. This will provide an alternative to standard tracking technology, such as acoustic telemetry fish tracking, which are often not appropriate for tracking at-risk fish species protected by legislation. Rather, the observation platform uses a combination of sensors including acoustic devices, visual and active sonar, and optical cameras. This will enable more in-depth scientific research and better support regulatory monitoring of at-risk fish species in fish passages or marine energy sites. Analysis of this data will require a robust and accurate method to automatically detect fish, count fish, and classify them by species in real-time using both sonar and optical cameras. To meet this need, we developed and tested an automated real-time deep learning framework combining state of the art convolutional neural networks and Kalman filters. First, we showed that an adaptation of the widely used YOLO machine learning model can accurately detect and classify eight species of fish from a public high resolution DIDSON imaging sonar dataset captured from the Ocqueoc River in Michigan, USA. Although there has been extensive research in the literature identifying particular fish such as eel vs. non-eel and seal vs. fish, to our knowledge this is the first successful application of deep learning for classifying multiple fish species with high resolution imaging sonar. Second, we integrated the Norfair object tracking framework to track and count fish using a public video dataset captured by optical cameras from the Wells Dam fish ladder on the Columbia River in Washington State, USA. Our results demonstrate that deep learning models can indeed be used to detect, classify species, and track fish using both high resolution imaging sonar and underwater video from a fish ladder. This work is a first step toward developing a fully implemented system which can accurately detect, classify and generate insights about fish in a wide variety of fish passage environments and conditions with data collected from multiple types of sensors.</p>},

@article{HASAN2022,
	abstract = {The fishing industry has become an important income source in the world. However, fish diseases are considered a serious problem among the fishermen as it tends to spread quickly through the water. In decades, fish diseases have been diagnosed manually by the naked eyes of experienced fish farmers. Despite being time-consuming since some lab works are required in determining the relevant microorganisms that cause the diseases, this classical method most often leads to an inaccurate and misleading result. Accordingly, a fast and inexpensive method is therefore important and desirable. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) performance has recently been demonstrated in a variety of computer vision and machine learning problems. Thus, a study on fish diseases detection using CNN is proposed. A total of 90 images of healthy leaf and two types of fish diseases which are White spot and Red spot was tested. The application of CNN to a variety of testing datasets returned good detection accuracy at 94.44\%. It can be inferred that the CNN is relatively good in detecting and classifying the type of diseases among infected fishes. Regardless, a study with a better number of datasets could be done in the future to improve the detection performance.},

@article{FORE20181,
	abstract = {Aquaculture production of finfish has seen rapid growth in production volume and economic yield over the last decades, and is today a key provider of seafood. As the scale of production increases, so does the likelihood that the industry will face emerging biological, economic and social challenges that may influence the ability to maintain ethically sound, productive and environmentally friendly production of fish. It is therefore important that the industry aspires to monitor and control the effects of these challenges to avoid also upscaling potential problems when upscaling production. We introduce the Precision Fish Farming (PFF) concept whose aim is to apply control-engineering principles to fish production, thereby improving the farmer's ability to monitor, control and document biological processes in fish farms. By adapting several core principles from Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), and accounting for the boundary conditions and possibilities that are particular to farming operations in the aquatic environment, PFF will contribute to moving commercial aquaculture from the traditional experience-based to a knowledge-based production regime. This can only be achieved through increased use of emerging technologies and automated systems. We have also reviewed existing technological solutions that could represent important components in future PFF applications. To illustrate the potential of such applications, we have defined four case studies aimed at solving specific challenges related to biomass monitoring, control of feed delivery, parasite monitoring and management of crowding operations.},

@article{PAPANDROULAKIS2002,
	abstract = {The continuous on-line meeting of metabolic demand via feed supply is an important factor for successful aquaculture. This factor is more acute for small larvae, which have a relatively high metabolism, implicating a long photophase and continuous feeding. Such requirements can not be easily met using classic manual feeding methods due to logistic problems. A computerized system has been developed for feed management in intensive hatcheries. The daily plankton requirements of larvae, organized in feeding tables together with a distribution pattern, was used for the development of the required hardware and software to control feeding. The system computes the food required (plankton organisms) and activates a peristaltic pump and solenoid valves for distribution to tanks. The system offers the option of feeding either according to tables or manually, depending on the concentration of plankton in the rearing tanks. Feeding is programmable for 24-h periods. A pilot scale application gave comparable results from a biological perspective and improved management when compared with standard methodologies. Four populations of sea bream (Sparus aurata) were reared with the pseudo-green water intensive method using the automated feeding system and two were reared using a standard technique. Larvae in both cases reached a total length of 10.73$\pm$0.77 mm in 30 days post hatching with survival varying between 41 and 51% without differences between the conditions tested. In terms of management, the labor requirement for feeding was reduced by 30--40% with the use of the automated feeding system while the utilization of Artemia nauplii was reduced by 40%. Feeding data as well as information concerning growth of the larvae and the evolution of the rearing were collected in a database. The system is compatible with other software packages for data collection and retrieval.},

@article{XANG2021,
	abstract = {Abstract The rapid emergence of deep learning (DL) technology has resulted in its successful use in various fields, including aquaculture. DL creates both new opportunities and a series of challenges for information and data processing in smart fish farming. This paper focuses on applications of DL in aquaculture, including live fish identification, species classification, behavioural analysis, feeding decisions, size or biomass estimation, and water quality prediction. The technical details of DL methods applied to smart fish farming are also analysed, including data, algorithms and performance. The review results show that the most significant contribution of DL is its ability to automatically extract features. However, challenges still exist; DL is still in a weak artificial intelligence stage and requires large amounts of labelled data for training, which has become a bottleneck that restricts further DL applications in aquaculture. Nevertheless, DL still offers breakthroughs for addressing complex data in aquaculture. In brief, our purpose is to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the current state of the art of DL in aquaculture, which can provide strong support for implementing smart fish farming applications.},
